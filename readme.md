#Windows Utilities

This is a compilation of various useful windows utilities I use those **batch scripts** on the sendto folder should be used from the send to menu, you can open this folder by writting **"shell:sendto"** without quotes, then you can *paste those files*.

**Python scripts** require you to install the **python interpreter** for windows under [python's webpage](https://www.python.org/). After that **a few packages are needed**, you just have to look on the first import statements to figure those out.

I like to have a powershell init file with functions to run those scripts more elegantly, that way I don't need to add folders to the *PATH*. You can edit it by opening a powershell terminal (or windows new terminal since W11) and typing **"notepad $PROFILE"** without quotes. Then you can paste what you consider. Don't forget to move those python scripts to an appropiate folder.
